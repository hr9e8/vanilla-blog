## Problem

I didn't understand:

- how HTTP works
- how we separate our server files and why we do it that way
- how routes, controllers and middleware worked
- how to fetch data from the database from the client and server
- how JWT, cookies and session worked

So I worked on this simple project to get closer to understanding all that.

It's not perfect. There's a lot of things I didn't implement. But I am happy with what I learnt.

## What this project does?

A user can register, sign in and create posts. They can publish their posts. And they can make each post private or public.

## How I did it?

This project uses vanilla JS, CSS, HTML, ExpressJS and Postrgesql.
